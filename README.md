# RL-Simulation
These codes were written with the help of claude.ai.
It is a live visual representation of how Reinforcement Learning algorithms work.
*The first program is a simulation of the simple Q-learning algorithm.* It represents how the parameters alpha, gamma & epsilon works.
The user can also edit the parameters and see the effect in action. I believe this will help the beginners to understand Q-Learning more efficiently.
